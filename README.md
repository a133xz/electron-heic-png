This project is a wrapper of [this npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/heic-convert) using Electron. It was inspired by fellow Electron desktop app, [Image shrinker](https://github.com/stefansl/image-shrinker).

ðŸš€ **An important achievement** of this project is the boilerplate I've developed to create small **apps with Vue.js 3, Parcel 2, and Electron** very easily and quickly. There are powerful projects around, but no super simple approach.

ðŸ‘‰ So [check out the boilerplate](https://github.com/a133xz/electron-vuejs-parcel-boilerplate) if you're interested in creating a similar project.

App designed by [Antonio Lozano](https://dribbble.com/panglozano).

## ðŸ’» Scripts

Make sure you have Yarn installed and clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/a133xz/electron-heic-png.git`

- `yarn` to install dependencies
- `yarn serve` to run locally Vue.js + electron
- `yarn vue:serve` to run locally only Vue.js
- `yarn build:local` to build the project locally
- `yarn patch` to add a patch version and push the changes

**Troubleshooting**

If you've installled the dependencies with Yarn or NPM and it's still not working, reinstall Parcel:

`yarn add -D parcel@next`

Or when using NPM, run:

`npm install -D parcel@next`
