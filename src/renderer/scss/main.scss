// Modules
@import "variables";
@import "utils";
// SCSS
@import "normalize";
@import "app";

// The organization is simple:
//
// _variables --> base font-size, typography and colours,
// _utils --> breakpoints, space utilities, rem-cal for the fonts
// _normalize --> a tiny version to cover missing scenarios
// _app --> pretty much everything left
//
// I could possible separate `_utils` in mixins and functions or
// create a new file for `typography` but since this project is
// about creating a MVP this is the aproach I found that works better
//
// It's important to say that neither `_utils` or `variable` should have any css,
// only normalize and app.
// In summanry you'll only use Variables and app
